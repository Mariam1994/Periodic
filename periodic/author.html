He achieved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenure" title="tenure">tenure</a> in <time>1867</time>, and by <time>1871</time> had transformed Saint Petersburg into an internationally recognized center for chemistry research.

His divorce from Leshcheva was finalized one month after he had married Popova <q class="parenthesis">on <time>2 April</time></q> in early <time>1882</time>.

						Mendeleev also investigated the composition of petroleum, and helped to found the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refinery" title="oil refinery">oil refinery</a> in Russia. He recognized the importance of petroleum as a feedstock for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrochemical" title="petrochemicals">petrochemicals</a>. He is credited with a remark that burning petroleum as a fuel <q>would be akin to firing up a kitchen stove with bank notes</q>.

						In <time>1905</time>, Mendeleev was elected a member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Swedish_Academy_of_Sciences" title="Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences">Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</a>. The following year the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Committee_for_Chemistry" title="Nobel Committee for Chemistry">Nobel Committee for Chemistry</a> recommended to the Swedish Academy to award the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry" title="Nobel Prize in Chemistry">Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a> for <time>1906</time> to Mendeleev for his discovery of the periodic system. The Chemistry Section of the Swedish Academy supported this recommendation. The Academy was then supposed to approve the Committee's choice, as it has done in almost every case. Unexpectedly, at the full meeting of the Academy, a dissenting member of the Nobel Committee, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Klason" title="Peter Klason">Peter Klason</a>, proposed the candidacy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Moissan" title="Henri Moissan">Henri Moissan</a> whom he favored. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svante_Arrhenius" title="Svante Arrhenius">Svante Arrhenius</a>, although not a member of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, had a great deal of influence in the Academy and also pressed for the rejection of Mendeleev, arguing that the periodic system was too old to acknowledge its discovery in <time>1906</time>. According to the contemporaries, Arrhenius was motivated by the grudge he held against Mendeleev for his critique of Arrhenius's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid%E2%80%93base_reaction#Arrhenius_definition" title="dissociation theory">dissociation theory</a>. After heated arguments, the majority of the Academy voted for Moissan. The attempts to nominate Mendeleev in <time>1907</time> were again frustrated by the absolute opposition of Arrhenius.
